# Ouroboros
Code that writes code.

Setup your API key in a "key.txt" file and modify the remote_agent file to reflect the location of your key.

By default, this code uses GPT-3.5 but you can use GPT-4 by changing the remote_agent file. 

Put the product that you want to build in the "product" field of the config file in config/.

Run the code using the run.py file.

Run.py takes three command-line arguments: (1) a product_name and (2) a number of instances you want to run at one time (default 1), (3) a debug flag (default False), which determines whether the app is run in debug mode or not.

The number of instances determines how many simultaneous attempts are set up to build the project. 

The project assumes your python version is called as "python3" from the shell. If not, edit the developer file to reflect how python is called on yoru system.

It works most of the time. Is a product retries count that you can set in config, which will restart the whole process n times. There is also a developer retries count feature, which you set in the same place, and which will just retry a particular code step m times.

Completed code goes in the project folder under the product_name. If you ran multiple instances then each one gets an id.
